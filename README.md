Project Steps

## 1.Importing the Dataset

Open the Excel file and navigate to the bike_buyers sheet.

Copy the data into a new sheet named Working Sheet for processing.

## 2. Removing Duplicates

Go to the Working Sheet.

Select all the data.

Navigate to Data > Remove Duplicates to ensure no duplicate entries exist.

## 3. Data Standardization

a. Standardizing Marital Status

Replace "M" with "Married" and "S" with "Single" using the Find and Replace tool.

b. Standardizing Gender

Replace "M" with "Male" and "F" with "Female" using the same tool.

## 4. Adding a New Column: Age Brackets

Insert a new column named Age Brackets.

Use the following logic to group ages:

"Young" for ages < 30.

"Middle Aged" for ages 30 to 50.

"Old" for ages > 50.

## 5. Creating Pivot Tables

Navigate to Insert > Pivot Table.

Select the data range and insert a pivot table into a new sheet.

Create pivot tables to analyze:

Bike purchases by age brackets.

Trends in bike purchases by income level.

Regional variations in bike purchases.

## 6. Visualizing Data with Charts

Insert charts based on the pivot tables:

Column Charts for income trends

Line charts for bike purchases based on customer's distance.

Line charts for bike purchases by age brackets.

Pie charts for regional distribution.

### Observations:

Middle-aged individuals show the highest bike purchase rate.

Higher income levels correlate with increased bike purchases.

Europe has the most bike purchases compared to other regions.

## 7. Creating a Dashboard

Consolidate key visualizations into a single dashboard sheet:

Copy and arrange pivot charts neatly.

Use slicers for interactivity, allowing dynamic filtering by region, age bracket, or income.
